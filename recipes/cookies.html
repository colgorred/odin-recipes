    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g Walnuts (Without Skins)</li>
        <li>400g Milk Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>230g Cold Butter, Cubed</li>
        <li>160g Caster Sugar</li>
        <li>160g Soft Light Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>200g Self-Raising Flour</li>
        <li>300g Plain Flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 Large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flours, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Start by adding the cold butter to the bowl of a standmixer, giving it a quick pulse with the paddle to loosen the butter. Add the sugars and briefly stir until just combined. Add the chocolate chips and walnuts and stir until just combined. Add the dry ingredients and stir until a breadcrumb like consistency. Add the beaten eggs and stir until just combined. </li>
        <li>Form into rough balls weighing 125g each, and freeze for at least 90 min. Preheat the oven to 185c/365f with a parchment lined baking sheet inside. Once the oven has come up to temperature, put the frozen dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the preheated baking sheet. Bake for 17 min.</li>
