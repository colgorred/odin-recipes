    <h2>Turn teatime into an event by making your own crumpets on the hob.</h3>
    <p>
        These require a little patience, but you just cannot beat a homemade crumpet.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon caster sugar/li>
        <li>300g strong white flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>vegetable oil , for greasing/li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently warm the milk. In a bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm milk and 100ml of tepid water. Leave in a warm place for 15 minutes, or until frothy.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda and 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>Whisk from the centre outwards until the consistency of double cream – this will take a few minutes. Add a splash more water, if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside for 45 minutes or until little bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>Grease four 10cm egg rings with vegetable oil. Wipe a little oil around a large frying pan or iron skillet and place over a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rings in the frying pan and, once hot, spoon 4 tablespoons of the batter into each ring. Cook for 5 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface.</li>
        <li>Once the bubbles have burst, leaving little holes, use tongs to carefully lift off the rings and flip over the crumpets, then cook for 1 minute on the other side. Re-grease and reheat the rings and pan before cooking the next batch.</li>
        <li>Serve the crumpets warm, with a slather of butter. If making them in advance, just toast lightly on both sides when you come to serve them.</li>
